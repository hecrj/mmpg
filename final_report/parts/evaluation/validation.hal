chapter "Validation"
label :validation

p "This chapter studies whether the project's **secondary objectives** described in #autoref{specification}
have been fullfiled after the **implementation process**. Then, after that study, it ponders whether
**the solution obtained fullfills the main objective**."

section "Secondary objectives"
subsection "Develop an abstract game engine"

p "During the entire implementation process, one of the main concerns has been to avoid adding any game-specific code
in the **engine** component.

Moreover, the **engine architecture** is entirely decoupled from any game built on
top of it.

Furthermore, the **engine** provides an abstraction that games can override to customize certain aspects:
like **world generation**, **game-loop timestep**, etc."

subsection "Allow hot-swapping of AIs"
p "This **AI hot-swapping** feature was implemented in #autoref{deployment_ai}. Also, it has been tested constantly
thanks to the **implementation methodology** described in #autoref{methodology}."

subsection "Implement a real-time webviewer"
p "The **engine** was able to notify game events in real-time since the first prototype implemented in
#autoref{first_prototype}."

subsection "Create a control panel"
p "The **control panel** was the last feature implemented, in #autoref{control_panel}.

However, it might be too simplistic, as it only allows to **play and pause** the match.
Hence, more features will probably be needed before using it in a production environment, like
monitoring of players in real-time, banning players, etc. These features should be easy to implement by
extending the **engine**, the **API** and the **client**."

subsection "Make the infrastructure scalable and stable"
p "First, the platform was designed with scalability in mind:"

enumerate:
  item; p "The **engine** and the **API** can work from different machines."
  item; p "Multiple **engine workers** can be used to distribute **AI calculations** in different machines."
  item; p "**Viewers** can be statically served by a simple service like **|Apache|** #cite{apache} or **|nginx|** #cite{nginx}."

p "
On the other hand, **stability** has ben assessed through **continuous integration** described in the **implementation
methodology** in #autoref{methodology}. The platform has been working **24/7** since the first prototype was deployed, **without
a single crash** and **without any anomaly**.

#autoref{mmpg_cpu} and #autoref{mmpg_io} show the **CPU usage** and **disk IO** in a period of 30 days in
the **integration server**, respectively. An increase in CPU usage and disk IO
can be observed when **a whole galaxy** was generated but it was fixed later, as it is described in #autoref{whole_galaxy}."
