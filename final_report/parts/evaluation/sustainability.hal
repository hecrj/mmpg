chapter "Sustainability"

p "This chapter contains a basic sustainability report of the project based on the method described by
Christian Felber in `The economy of the common good' #cite{sustainability_report}."

section "Economic analysis"
p "The economical analysis was complete and thorough, all costs are assessed and reasonable.
Resources were used efficiently, more time was spenth in the most important tasks. Moreover, the best technologies
were chosen to produce the best results in the least amount of time possible. A contingency budget was added
to take care of any unexpected problems.

However, the project is not aimed to be profitable, so there will be no direct economic benefit from it."

section "Social impact analysis"
p "The project is directed to computer science students and teachers, and game progammers. The project
will be used by students to learn different programming techniques, by teachers to evaluate these students, and
by game programmers to create new content.

Moreover, it will be used in the Data Structures and Algorithms subject
at the Barcelona School of Informatics (**FIB**). The project will make the learning process more fun, it will also
reduce the amount of work for teachers, and it will make game programmers able to create entertaining games easily.

However, the project will not affect the mainstream consumer directly. It will only be relevant inside a specific
community in computer science."

section "Environmental impact analysis"
p "The project used 177kWh of electricity, which is approximately 174kg of CO#textsuperscript{2} #cite{co2}.
This is the amount of CO#textsuperscript{2} that a car produces by driving only 7
hours#footnote{#url{http://www.yousustain.com/footprint/howmuchco2?co2=174+kg}}. Also, any source of
information was accessed digitally over the internet.

However, the hardware used can not be fully recycled and it will, eventually, become electronic waste
with a high amount of contaminants."
