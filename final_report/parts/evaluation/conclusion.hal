chapter "Conclusion"

p "This last chapter closes the project by summarizing the document, detailing the future of the project and
giving the author personal thoughts."

section "Summary"
p "This document detailed the building process of a platform for MMPGs.

Firstly, the requirement for MMPGs games was established. Then, it was shown that there was not
an existing solution to satisfy it. Thus, the requirement was analyzed and a solution was designed. This solution
featured a set of different components that allowed the creation of MMPGs.

Secondly, the development of the solution was planned. A time plan and a budget for the solution were shown.

Next, the implementation of the solution was detailed. Starting with a prototype and using continuous integration, the different
features that the solution needed were developed.

Finally, the implemented solution was evaluated. The solution was checked against the objectives of the project,
while also showing the time management during its implemenation and its final economic cost."

section "The future"
p "The future of this project is promising. Given that the platform is released as open source, the project will be maintained
by the author and, hopefully, by the community in the future.

Some of the tasks that will be performed in the near-future are:"

description:
  item "Documentation"; p "Different types of documentation will be written:"
  enumerate:
    item; p "A guide for developers will explain how to start developing a game with the platform with detail."
    item; p "A guide for contributors will help developers to contribute to the project."
    item; p "A guide for Space Wars will teach players how to install Space Wars and develop AIs locally."
    item; p "|README|s in every component will explain its responsibility in the platform."

  item "Widget library"; p "A library containing predefined viewer widgets will be implemented. Game developers will be
  able to use this widgets to implement viewer functionalities; like a login form, or the time control, for example."

  item "Game template"; p "A simple game will be created. This game might be used by game developers as a starting point.
  Forking the repository of this game will give game developers a simple fully-functional game out-of-the-box."

  item "Game-logic testing suite"; p "The engine will get its own testing suite, so game developers will be able test the logic
  of their games easily."
