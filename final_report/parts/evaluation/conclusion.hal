chapter "Conclusion"

p "This last chapter closes the project by summarizing the document, detailing the future of the project and
giving the author personal thoughts."

section "Summary"
p "This document detailed the building process of a platform for MMPGs.

First, the requirement for MMPGs games was established. Then, it was shown that there was not
an existing solution to satisfy it. Thus, the requirement was analyzed and a solution was designed. This solution
featured a set of different components that allowed the creation of MMPGs.

Second, the development of the solution was planned. A time plan and a budget for the solution were shown.

Next, the implementation of the solution was detailed. Starting with a prototype and using continuous integration, the different
features that the solution needed were developed.

Finally, the implemented solution was evaluated. The solution was checked against the objectives of the project,
while also showing the time management during its implemenation and its final economic cost."

section "The future"
p "The future of this project is promising. Given that the platform is released as open source, the project will be maintained
by the author and, hopefully, by the community in the future.

Some of the tasks that will be performed in the near-future are:"

description:
  item "Documentation"; p "Different types of documentation will be written:"
  enumerate:
    item; p "A guide for developers will explain how to start developing a game with the platform with detail."
    item; p "A guide for contributors will help developers to contribute to the project."
    item; p "A guide for Space Wars will teach players how to install Space Wars and develop AIs locally."
    item; p "|README|s in every component will explain its responsibility in the platform."

  item "Widget library"; p "A library containing predefined viewer widgets will be implemented. Game developers will be
  able to use this widgets to implement viewer functionalities; like a login form, or the time control, for example."

  item "Game template"; p "A simple game will be created. This game might be used by game developers as a starting point.
  Forking the repository of this game will give game developers a simple fully-functional game out-of-the-box."

  item "Game-logic testing suite"; p "The engine will get its own testing suite, so game developers will be able test the logic
  of their games effortlessly."

section "Personal thoughts"
p "It is difficult to express my thoughts after such a long project.

When I started, I did not imagine I would have to develop so many different components at the same time. However, I really
liked the implementation methodology used in the project. Being able to deploy changes automatically and show them
to anyone was motivating. Also, it surprises me how low the time spent debugging has been. Bugs were detected
and fixed really fast.

I have learned a lot during this project. I did not know how to code in |Go| when I started. Right now, it is
another tool in my toolbox. Three.js was also new to me, and I've been amazed by how powerful it is. I have also learned about 
the different low-level libraries to implement inter-process communication, which I had never used for anything serious
before this project. Moreover, procedural generation was one of those topics that interested me but never tried.
I have been constantly learning and mixing my knowledge with new concepts.

I have mixed feelings with the outcome of this project. I think it is really promising, but I would have liked to
offer a more finished and better documented solution.

At the end, though, developing this project has been a really fun and rewarding experience and I am sure it will
benefit me deeply in my incoming professional career."
