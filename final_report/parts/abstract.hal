  p "This project states that a platform for multiplayer programming games with a high
  number of players and long matches is needed. It provides a design of an open-source solution to satisfy this necessity
  and describes its implementation using a methodology based on continuous integration. Finally, the implemented solution
  is evaluated, concluding that it is a good candidate for such a platform."
